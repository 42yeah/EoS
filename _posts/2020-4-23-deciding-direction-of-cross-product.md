title: Identifying The Direction Of Cross Product
---

When you are doing math, you might come up with a question: what's the general direction of a cross product, you know, without boring calculation?

$$
\vec c = \vec a \times \vec b
$$

Well, we use the right hand law! It's pretty much like the right hand law in electromagnetic or whatever, excuse my physics. Anyway, when $$\vec a \times \vec b$$ happens, you can draw a graph like this:

And put your right hand parallel to the $$\vec a$$, like this:

Now make your hand into a fist. Fistify your hand!

And finally, the thumb direction is the general cross product direction! Yeah! That's why when you do $$\vec b \times \vec a$$, you get the exact opposite direction.

This is just a reminder for myself.
