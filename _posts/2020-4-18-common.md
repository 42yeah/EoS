Sometimes, the games are many, and the time is little. How can you quickly find the common games between you and your friend? Well, I am going to implement it here, and then tell you how to implement (It's pretty easy)! Also, I definitely won't track you (this site has analytics though. Please keep it on because I only have ~2 visitors every day!).

## Try It Out

First, you need to get your Web Steam API Key here: [https://steamcommunity.com/dev/registerkey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/registerkey). Then, you need to go to your own and your friend's Steam profile page, which could be checked out in your username â†’ View my profile. Copy the part after slash id until you meet another slash. In my case, `42yeah`.

If there's no URL there, you might want to display it:

And now, fill out this form:

Key: <input id="key" placeholder="A4Z3588D0877690DE296EF735A2813Z3" value="D5F3288D0877690DE096BB735A2616A3">

Player A's Id: <input id="a" placeholder="42yeah">

Player B's Id: <input id="b" placeholder="penegrine">

[Submit](javascript:submit())
<script src="/assets/scg/client.js"></script>

<style>
.list {
    max-height: 20em;
    overflow: scroll;
    border-top: 3px dashed #efefef;
    border-bottom: 3px dashed #efefef;
}

.list-item {
    margin-top: -1px;
    text-align: center;
    border: 1px solid #eeeeee;
    color: #333;
    padding: 0.2em;
}

.list-item:hover {
    background-color: aliceblue;
}
</style>

<div class="list" id="list">
