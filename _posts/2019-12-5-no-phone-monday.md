No Phone Monday is just as its name intended, that you play __no phone__ on Monday! It's gonna be a little challenge set by myself. I dunno why I am setting this challenge for myself. Maybe I am pursuing a greater goal or something, I don't care. Mais, here's the rule:

- No phone on Monday.
- I can use computer & other stuffs, as long as it is not that of iOS or Android or any system based on a RISC command set.
- If I fail, I am gonna post my failure date here.
- The No Phone Monday starts from 8:30 (start of the first class) to 21:30 (maybe after I finished bathing).
- I can use phone as a meaning to access social media (such as wechat's phone auth), nothing else.

I hope everything will work out alright! At least I am not gonna fail in the first Monday, right?

Wish me luck!

Fun Fact: It is also abbreviated as NPM.
