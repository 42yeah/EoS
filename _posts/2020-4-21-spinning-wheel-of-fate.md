Have you ever stay up at night, feeling hungry, and decides to leave whether you should have a hot, satiating meal or not up to fate? Have you thought that if you roll more than 3, you could just go but this happens?

Then you feel like the random system they have is crappy and dammit, I am going to implement a physics-based spinning wheel so I can guarantee its ~~un~~fairness? Well fear no more my friend, for you've come to the right place! Today I present: the Spinning Wheel of __FATE__!

## Introduction

There is nothing to introduce! I am going to implement it right away! Aaaaarghh! I want my fried eggs so bad!

## Play Time

<canvas id="wheel" width="500px" height="500px" style="width: 250px; height: 250px; touch-action: none"></canvas>
<script src="/assets/wof/main.js"></script>
<div id="list"></div>

Degree: <input id="degree" placeholder="90, or empty to take up the rest" style="width: 15em">

Name: <input id="name" placeholder="Late night supper">

Color: <input id="color" placeholder="#abcdef, or empty for random" style="width: 20em">

<a href="javascript:add()">Add new chunk</a> \| <a href="javascript:clear()">Clear all</a>

## Implementation

Well, it's not that hard, really. Just draw a circle and implement all sorts of physics stuffs. You can view the source tree [here](https://github.com/42yeah/EoS/tree/master/assets/wof).

## Conclusion

There is no conclusion. I am going to cook now.

## References

Why would there be references? I am so hungry!
