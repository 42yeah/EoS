I am gonna migrate the contents in my [original blog](https://42yeah.github.io). It’s mostly Chinese. Well all of them Chinese.

Since I’ve been looking for a better blogging platform recently, this is the best one I’ve seen. I guess someone’s actually going to see what I post here! Everything is so hopeful!

At the mean time, let’s talk a bit about myself. I am an undergrad studying in Dongguan University of Technology. I major in Computer Science, but somehow I didn’t really wanna learn that. Now my thought is to take part in the China Postgrad Examination and become a postgrad myself, while switching my field of study to Computer Graphics in the process. I know it’s hard, but I also know it’s gonna be fun, and I am going to have a great time. It just feels right!

I guess I am stopping here. See you soon! You can contact me in whatever way you want: my email, my vivaldi mail, github, twitter, paypal, QQ (214346692), Wechat (EMPOWEREDBYCOLA), and many more. Well, I am looking forward to your call since nobody contacted me in my old blog! See ya :P!
